# expression-calculator

 Hi my name is Hatim!
    This program allows you to enter an expression in the command line and it will show you the result.

#**I have divided it into 3 parts:**

1-enter the expression and evaluate it
2-convert expression to postfix*
3-calculate the result
    
*in order to fully understand the second part, I recommend that you consult these two blogs:

    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-set-2-infix-to-postfix/

    https://www.includehelp.com/c/infix-to-postfix-conversion-using-stack-with-c-program.aspx

#**Edge cases:**

1-I didn't take in consideration expression that include parentheses so the expression need to be just numbers and operations.
2-numbers you entered must be between 0->9.

##*Notes:*
Going forward, I will work to fix these bugs as soon as possible. I will be grateful to receive your comments on my work.

I appreciate the time you gave me. Have a good day.
