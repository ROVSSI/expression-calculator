# expression calculator:pencil2:

Hi my name is Hatim! :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:

This program allows you to enter an expression in the command line and it will show you the result.

# **I have divided it into 3 parts::file_cabinet:**

- enter the expression and evaluate it

- convert expression to postfix*

- calculate the result
    
*in order to fully understand the second part, [I recommend that you consult this blog](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-set-2-infix-to-postfix/)

# **Edge cases: :face_with_head_bandage:** 

- I didn't take in consideration expression that include parentheses so the expression need to be just numbers and operations.

- numbers you entered must be between 0->9.

## *Notes::thought_balloon:*
- Going forward, I will work to fix these bugs as soon as possible. I will be grateful to receive your comments on my work.

    I appreciate the time you gave me. Have a good day.:innocent:
